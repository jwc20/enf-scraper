1034915,3.5,"I had lunch
I ordered homemade carpreje platter, red shrimp ink capellini, Iberico bone sirloin steak, prime salchis steak, tiramisu, lemon tiramisu, house wine, and cider
The atmosphere was good. I think it's a good place for a date. I want you to clean up the garbage (waste paper, finished cider cans) that is generated while eating. It's not sensible to just serve the food every time it comes out in the order of appetizer, main dish, and dessertI thought, he put water in a green bottle, but he never brought it to me until I finished drinking it. The service was very disappointing and there was a hassle of having to ask for it one by one. Even so, the water was collected in one place, but it was really uncomfortable to keep the house intact. Moving on to the taste of food
As an appetizer, Homemade Caprese Platter was delicious because it was a good combination of bread, ricotta cheese, basil pesto, and fresh sweet tomatoes. My sister is a high school girl and it's the bestThat's what he said
The red shrimp capellini tasted like eating spaghetti noodles in galbitang. It felt bland and it was a dull sauce and regular chewy spaghetti noodles. More than anything, the chubby red shrimp was so delicious that it flipped over Only the shrimp was really good. 
Iberico Pluma Steak and Wagyu Salchi Steak were also delicious. Plumastakes were a little tough and wagyu salchi steaks were very popular with younger brothers. It was a steak that captivated the taste buds of elementary school students. The spicy stir-fried chili pepper was good for catching the fat of the meat, and the flesh steak sauce was sweet and went well with the meat. House wine was just a cost-effective wine
It was my youngest sister's birthday and she lit a candle on the tiramisu and congratulated me, so I was able to make good memories for her Thank you.
The younger members liked regular tiramisu, and for my taste, tiramisu that tasted like fresh lemon whipped cream cake was perfect for dessert My mouth felt refreshed. I don't think I'm going to revisit, but I'm going to stay in a nice and nice place

I couldn't see Namsan Tower as a whole, but only the table we sat on seemed to be visible.

Parfaccio and poached egg Caesar salad.
I ordered red shrimp and poccini pasta 
sitting down at 6 o'clock 
(There is a time limit until 7:20.)

Parfacio came out around 10 minutes and showed us a smoke performance, so I was satisfied with the taste and sight.

Caesar salad was served for about 20 minutes and I was waiting for pasta
The pasta comes out 25 minutes later, around 45 minutes later 
I think I ate it a little tight.  
There were a lot of people saying it's salty, but I liked it because it was just a little bit

But I wish you'd told me before serving

*Truffle Porchini Mushroom Daliatelle: Not impressive enough to eat here.  It was covered with mushroom slices, but it was raw mushrooms, so it felt like it was going out of the way with pasta noodles because it didn't absorb the sauce well. It'll be better if you slice it thinner

However, the unfortunate thing was that the noodles felt undercooked when I ate thick pasta. Of course, it seems that they took into account the time to order various menus, but the pasta, which is similar to Petuccini, has less time to cook and absorbs the sauce than the dry noodles, so it was a shame that the noodles played separately from the sauce. Nevertheless, the reason why I want to revisit is that the store has the expectation that if you look at my comments and secure them, they will be able to eat much more deliciously next time, and they have paid attention to them in detail in terms of dealing with customers. It was a pleasant meal until we left after the meal, with the replacement of plates and cutlery after the meal, completely controlling the speed of food served.

Entering the store, you can see a work space for extracting raw noodles, probably with a noodle maker in front of you. Inside, there is an open-type kitchen that is not big, so you can see chefs cooking.

Sitting in a reserved seat, I ordered red shrimp & ink capellini (25,000 won) and truffle porcini & mushroom daliatelle (23,000 won). First of all, the signature menu here, red shrimp & ink capellini, was cooked enough for shrimp to eat on the capellini noodles made of ink. In particular, the sauce was impressive, and it was made of crab or shrimp base, so the flavor exploded.

Another menu using ""Taliatelle,"" the most typical type of Italian pasta, tasted and flavored Porchini, famous for its taste comparable to truffles, with truffle oil and pesto, which was even better because the flat noodles made the mushroom smell good.

I ordered Galbi Ragu & Black Pepper Reginetti (25,000 won) additionally because 2 pasta was not enough for me as a glutton. The texture of the winding ""resignetti"" noodles and the taste of finely chopped ribs gave the impression of fusion Korean food and ate it quite deliciously.

There were a lot of reviews that the food was salty, but I liked it because it tasted right. Especially, the unexpected ""Salcicia lemon butter yolk d'aliatelle"" was really amazing. I wanted to try other menus, but I refrained because of the price burdenHaha

Especially, the yellow pasta in that picture (salcicha lemon butter & yolk) was very unique and delicious!
Compared to the Daliatelle I know, the noodles were very wide, but it was thin and soft, so the sauce was smeared well. The combination was crazy because the lemon covered the soft taste of butter, yolk, and cheese. 
How did you come up with this combination because of the unique and salty taste of salsicha sausage? ü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏è

Let's go eat other pasta, too! 
Seasonal steamed clams are also delicious! It's not a unique taste, but it's full of basil pesto and garlic, so Koreans will like it. It's a base that goes well with mussels rather than clams.ü§§

It's delicious and fresh, and even if the combination is somewhat ordinary, it's visual fun to see the harmony of the dishes. Pasta is a pretty fun and enjoyable composition if you let go of your expectations for raw pasta. It may be difficult to come by this alone, but it's a combination of taste and no regrets. The steak was much better than I expected. The rich juices felt like using quality meat, and all the combinations of roasting and gravy sauce were excellent. The dessert itself was easy to taste, but the Christmas-conscious design stood out and I liked it because it was pretty.  However, in terms of service, it is a little disappointing for this price range. For example, the store as a whole is cold and feet cold, and after several courses, they do not exchange tableware, so there is a regret that you have to enjoy delicious food mixed with the previous course. It was a shame that some people couldn't maintain the temperature because they came to the cold plate. But overall, it was good to enjoy Christmas.

2224802,3.7,"The food was really delicious and I liked the view of Namsan Tower and Seoul. I really want to try other pasta. I was a little disappointed because the tiramisu tastes normal. 

However, considering the price of food, there were improvements in terms of service. Rather than being unfriendly, it felt like there was no service suitable for the price level. 

1. Tablet Order: I think self-ordering using a tablet is a typical reduction in labor costs. I was looking forward to a luxurious atmosphere, but I was disappointed because it was self-ordering with a tablet at the table. I think a restaurant should basically have a person explain the food and take the order themselves. 

2. Korean food served all at once: We ordered a set menu, and the menu was a typical course meal. Obviously, appetizers - entrees - steaks - should be served in the order of dessert, but before I even had one course, the next came out, and all the courses except dessert came out, so the food cooled down quickly while I was eating. I felt that the Korean table setting at an Italian restaurant didn't fit my taste. I think it's basic to ask if you want at least a table and serve it. 

3. Tablet Notice - I read it because the staff asked me to read the tablet notice before ordering. I was wondering what was important, but it was that we had to order drinks and alcohol together. I think you should explain why when it violates your choice. a tablet announcement that determines
I thought it was very inappropriate. I felt a bit strongly to ask for a drink or alcohol, even though I was ordering drinks and alcohol at a high-end dynamo, but it was a must-read. 

It wasn't unfriendly at all or the food wasn't tasty, but it was a bit of a shame that it was no different from the way of service in most normal ""today"" restaurants, from ordering to paying.",2023-12-02 10:39:07,"https://ugc-images.catchtable.co.kr/rv/sGH-fb5s4R_O3VqK2Cu8qFw/01954dccb6cc46ae8e37a5e5825b51bf, https://ugc-images.catchtable.co.kr/rv/sGH-fb5s4R_O3VqK2Cu8qFw/9cde5ec826174cdca0806ab78dc152b9, https://ugc-images.catchtable.co.kr/rv/sGH-fb5s4R_O3VqK2Cu8qFw/3d2b920a89584f97acf956d50c0da9cc, https://ugc-images.catchtable.co.kr/rv/sGH-fb5s4R_O3VqK2Cu8qFw/1c67531a34dc4d51b92d5091eb120335",ÍøàÍæ∏Îäî ÎßõÏÇ¨ÎÉ•Íæº_5139
